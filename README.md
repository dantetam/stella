# Stella - Data Mining Division

Leverage the power of Stanford's CoreNLP library and experiment with NLP/ML algorithms such as kernel perceptrons, neural networks, etc., to mine massive amounts of collected web content for sentiment, summary, and trends.

Research methods of expressing the world in algorithms. Just as how a human processes large amounts of data through interacting neurons, Stella seeks to create deep neural networks and smart graphs that can capture the global information age.
